# Kaggle Notebooks Directory

### by: Nourman Hajar

This repository is a mirror for my Jupyter notebooks on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/masnormen/). It's automatically generated (including this README.md) and is updated once in a while. This notebooks collection will give you an insight on how I have been experimenting with exploratory data analysis (EDA), predicting target variables, and comparing model's performance. All explanation is included in the notebook.

I hope to learn more about data visualization and predictive analysis. I appreciate any comment and suggestion on my work. Thank you!

> **Note:** This GitHub repository only mirrors the .ipynb files without the printed/saved cells output, due to Kaggle's API policy. To see the full visualization and output on Kaggle, please refer to the links on the index below!
