# Kaggle Notebooks

This repository contains my notebook on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It's a platform for data scientists to solve data science, machine learning, and predictive analytics problems. In this notebooks collection, you will see how I have been experimenting with exploratory data analysis (EDA), predicting target variables, and comparing model's performance. All explanation is included in the notebook.

This repository is just **a mirror** for my [Kaggle notebooks](https://www.kaggle.com/masnormen/). This repository is automatically generated (including this README.md) and is updated once in a while.

I hope to learn more about data visualization and predictive analysis. I appreciate any comment and suggestion on my work. Thank you!
